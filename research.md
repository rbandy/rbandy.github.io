**Current Research**
- Uncertainty Quantification and Validation
    - Representing and learning the uncertainties in complex, physics-based
    computational models. However, the form of the computational model greatly
    influences our approach to quantifying uncertainties. If the model is
    defined by a system of equations, we explore learning the model-form error
    through embedded model corrections. If the model is defined by black-box
    observations, we explore a posterior representations of uncertainties.
    - Building data-driven models that adhere to physical constraints
    - Calibration and validation algorithms

**Current Projects**
- ACCurate and Reliable Uncertainty Estimates (ACCRUE)
    - Generating probabilistic forecasts by augmenting black-box outputs with an uncertainty distribution.
    - Extending to non-Guassian distributions.
- Model-form error in ODEs with missing variables
- Model-form error in systems with missing variables and simplified physics
