**Current Research**
- Uncertainty Quantification and Validation
    - Reducing the model error and observational error between observations from a detailed system and output from a low-fidelity model
    - Building data-driven models that adhere to physical constraints
    - Calibration and validation algorithms

**Previous Projects**
- Global Optimization of Chemical Systems
    - Investigated Basin-Hopping and Minima Hopping combinations and modifications
    in order to accuratly and efficiently predict the ground state of Lennard-Jones systems
    - [Software for Global Optimization](http://theory.cm.utexas.edu/tsase/global_optimizer.html)
    - [Global Optimization Database](http://fri.oden.utexas.edu/~fri/fridb_GO/server.py)

- Modeling Microstructure Evolution during Additive Manufacturing
    - Employed a data science approach and machine learning	to simulated additive manufacturing
